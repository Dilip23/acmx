# Platforms ID

Users need to specify problem/contest identifier to **acmX** for processing. This is an specification of what is every platform id.

## Codeforces

In [codeforces](https://codeforces.com) from the URL of a problem you can identify both contest id and problem id in the following format such that `PROBLEM_ID=CONTEST_ID-LETTER`:

https://codeforces.com/contest/{CONTEST_ID}/problem/{LETTER}

For example in problem (https://codeforces.com/contest/1101/problem/G) identifiers are `CONTEST_ID=1101` and `PROBLEM_ID=1101-G`.

Notice that contest id don't coincide with round number.
