# List of TODO

* **IMPORTANT** Add How to Use (in the README.) How to add own template etc...
* **IMPORTANT** Create custom settings. Add (TimeLimit, Checker)
* **WOW** Use this tool: [caide-cpp-inliner](https://github.com/slycelote/caide-cpp-inliner).  Suggestion from jcg
* When a new view is activated (after run or view:code) close all open tabs. (also (maybe) collapse everything not related to the problem)
* Allow programming in other languages than c++
* Figure out something for interactive problems.
* Allow stopping a running program (such as sol.cpp/brute.cpp/gen.py/etc...)
* Allow custom checker easily
* Add several checkers and try to infer which is the correct!

* [001](/src/core.ts): Revisit this constant. Show specific error to know when this is an issue. Add in settings
* [002](/src/core.ts): Avoid this hardcoded line. Use personalized compile line. increase stack by default. This involve allowing different languages
* [004](/src/core.ts): Make crossplatform call. Solution: Configure path to python in global settings
* [005](/src/core.ts): Restrict brute in time, and capture errors
* [007](/src/extension.ts): How can I have access to new proccess created using `openFolder`?
