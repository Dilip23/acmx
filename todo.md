# List of TODO

* **IMPORTANT** When Compilation Error throw a better error. (maybe with runtime error too)
* Add How to Use (in the README.) adding own template etc...
* Allow custom checker easily
* Add several checkers and try to infer which is the correct! [*]
* Smart ID detection while parsing ContestId & ProblemId [*]
* Smart generator [*]
* Find great name/slogan!!! other than acmhelper Competitive Programming made simple
* Implement parser for codeforces to test on real cases
* Learn how to move static files from `src` to `out`.
* Allow programming in other languages than c++
* Refactor Code!!
* When Runtime Error happens show as much output as possible and display the error in the console
* Figure out something for interactive problems.
* When a new view is activated (after run or view:code) close all open tabs. (maybe collapse everything not related to the problem)

* [001](/src/core.ts): Revisit this constant. Show specific error to know when this is an issue
* [002](/src/core.ts): Avoid this hardcoded line. Use personalized compile line. increase stack by default. This involve allowing different languages
* [003](/src/core.ts): **IMPORTANT** Report max time and maybe other stats. (TestSolution, Stress)
* [004](/src/core.ts): **NILOX** Revisit this call to python3. How to make it cross platform
* [005](/src/core.ts): Restrict brute in time, and capture errors
* [006](/src/extension.ts): **IMPORTANT** Provide custom problem id example in placeholder per different site
* [007](/src/extension.ts): How can I have access to new proccess created using `openFolder`?
* [008](/src/extension.ts): **IMPORTANT** Provide custom contest id example in placeholder per different site
* [009](/src/parsers/codeforces.ts): Use sync requests
* [010](/src/test/extension.test.ts): How to check if two arrays are equal

[*] Machine Learning?
